# Gambit - The Syslog Generator
# Gambit is an AI coded web app syslog generation tool built with Python, designed for security professionals to test, validate, and learn about security monitoring.

# Key Features
# Diverse Log Sources: Simulates logs from over a dozen common enterprise technologies, including AWS, Azure, GCP, Okta, CrowdStrike, and more.

# Two Generation Modes:

# Randomization Mode: Generates a continuous, mixed stream of logs from any combination of selected vendors. Includes a Custom Log feature to simulate unknown or unique log sources.

# Story Mode: Generates a specific sequence of logs that simulate a real-world attack, including scenarios like a "Web Server Breach" and tactics mapped to the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

# Realistic Scenarios: Automatically mixes in benign "noise" logs during story scenarios to provide a more challenging detection experience.

# Simple Web Interface: All controls are managed through an easy-to-use web page that displays generated logs in real-time.

# Flexible Output: Sends logs via UDP to any SIEM or log collector and provides an option to save logs locally to a CSV file.
