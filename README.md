# Gambit - The AI-coded Syslog Generator

Gambit is an AI coded syslog generator designed to simulate and send realistic syslog events to a SIEM platform.  It is a powerful tool for security professionals to test detection rules, validate and log ingestion. 

**Features**
Customizable, Flexible Log Generation: Sends logs from five different sources (http, ftp, router, switch, firewall) in popular formats including RFC3164, RFC5424, CEF, and LEEF. You can specify the vendor name and product type.

**Randomization Mode**: Generates a continuous, random stream of logs for baseline traffic analysis and load testing.

**Story Mode**: Simulates specific security incidents with a pre-defined sequence of events, allowing you to tell a security narrative. Current stories include:

  - Rogue Insider
  
  - Web Server Breach
  
  - Brute-Force & Data Theft

Noise Injection: Adds random background logs to Story Mode, making it more challenging and realistic to simulate real-world traffic.

Real-time Log Display: A live console in the web interface shows the logs as they are being sent.
